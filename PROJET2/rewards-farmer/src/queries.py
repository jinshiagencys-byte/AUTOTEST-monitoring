"""Where search queries come from.

Two backends. `llm` is the default and is unchanged, so nothing about an
existing setup moves. `trends` uses public feeds and needs no account, no
model and no key, which is the difference between running this in five
minutes and installing Ollama first.

    QUERY_SOURCE=trends python src/main.py

The LLM's whole job in this project is producing short strings to type into
Bing, and Bing's own autosuggest answers that question directly.
